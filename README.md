### Example Usage
```bash
# Create and initialize a new league with default teams
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/leagues/initialize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Premier League 2024"}'

# Add a new team
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/teams" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## üóÉÔ∏è Database

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:
- `teams` - Team information and strength ratings
- `leagues` - League configurations
- `matches` - Match fixtures and results
- `league_standings` - Real-time league standings

Default teams included:
- Manchester City (Strength: 88)
- Liverpool FC (Strength: 86) 
- Chelsea FC (Strength: 84)
- Arsenal FC (Strength: 82)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
BLUEPRINT_DB_HOST=localhost
BLUEPRINT_DB_PORT=5432
BLUEPRINT_DB_DATABASE=insider_league_manager
BLUEPRINT_DB_USERNAME=postgres
BLUEPRINT_DB_PASSWORD=password123
BLUEPRINT_DB_SCHEMA=public
PORT=8080
```

## üéØ Match Simulation Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated match simulation system:
- **Team Strength**: Each team has a strength rating (0-100)
- **Goal Expectancy**: Calculated based on relative team strengths
- **Random Generation**: Poisson distribution for realistic goal scoring
- **Home Advantage**: Subtle home field advantage in calculations

## üèÜ Championship Prediction

Monte Carlo simulation runs 10,000 scenarios to predict championship probabilities:
- Simulates remaining matches based on team strengths
- Calculates final standings for each simulation
- Provides percentage probability for each team winning
